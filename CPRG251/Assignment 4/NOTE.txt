Assignment 4 involved a Gui for java. I ain't doing that for python. Yet...

Assignment 4 included some additional concepts not yet covered or i've done yet such as custom exceptions and boolean expressions

So those are in here

The topics this assignment is supposed to teach is:
    - File reading(Not really causes it's the same tech as reading the TXT files in ass 1 and 2)
    - Random access file reading and writing
        * Reading and writing from a file, but instead of commas it bytes saying what it is
        * You tell when your done by moving the exact bytes rather than newline
        * A csv takes up less space then that.
        * I haven't seen a good use(or ever used it again) since taught, but theres a small showing in RandomAccessFile.py
